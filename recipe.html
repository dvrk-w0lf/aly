  <h2>Instructions (A step-by-step guide):</h2>

    <li>Prepare the beef: Season the beef slices with salt and pepper. In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef slices and cook until browned on both sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    <li>Saute the onions and mushrooms: In the same skillet, melt butter and sauté the onions until translucent. Add the minced garlic and mushrooms, and cook until the mushrooms are golden and the moisture evaporates.</li>
